# libJME

On this repository you will find all librairies (.jar) to use JMonkeyEngine on your favorite IDE.

I create this repository because I found anywhere JME librairies only. To take them, I had to install JME SDK and go on 
~/home/[username]/jmonkeyplatform/jmonkeyplatform/libs/ and on this folder there are all librairies of JME.
